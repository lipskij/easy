        <p>
          Freelance Filmmaker, Director of Photography/ Lighting Cameraman &
          Aerial Cinematographer I work as a freelance filmmaker, director and
          cinematographer based in Torbay, Devon, UK with a Bachelor of Arts –
          1st Degree Honours in Media Arts from the University of Plymouth.

          Often I see images and have ideas that I would like to share with
          others. This is how my films come about. I enjoy experimenting so my
          work covers a wide range of subjects, styles and techniques:
          documentaries, shorts, promotional, music videos, experimental and
          more!

          Primarily as a cinematographer, I operate on a RED digital cinema
          camera, but have experience with other camera systems from a wide
          array of brands Sony, Panasonic, Canon and Arri. I also have
          additional support kit, such as 360 motion control rigs for dynamic
          time-lapses and experience with steadycam or MoVI, DJI Ronin gimbal
          rigs.

          I am Licensed; CAA approved and a qualified pilot, holding a BNUC-s
          Theory and RPQ-s Flight Assessment certificates.

          I have an excellent understanding of editing and basic colour
          correction ranging across short-form tv and web commercials to
          documentary or music videos. Whilst using the Final Cut Pro or Adobe
          CC suite, my system is both on and offsite and able to edit and view
          4k content natively. Essential for high-end delivery.
